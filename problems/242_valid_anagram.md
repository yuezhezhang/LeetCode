# 242. Valid Anagram

## Desciption
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `false` otherwise.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

### Constraints: 
* 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
* `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

### Follow up: 
What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
