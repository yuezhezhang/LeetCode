# 704. Binary Search

## Description
Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.


### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

### Example 2
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```


### Constraints: 
* `1 <= nums.length <= 10000`
* `-10000 < nums[i], target < 10000`
* All the integer in `nums` are unique
* `nums` is sorted in ascending order
